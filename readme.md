wotlk-core
===================


Quick Description
--------------
WoTLK-core is my personal project. It is a WoW framework that attempts to emulate the servers used to run World of Warcraft as they were a few years ago. It is a ground-up project. That means without scripting, you have an entirely empty world as the client would see it. 

Requirements
--------------
- C++ compiler
- MySQL and a fully filled database
- Processor with SSE2 support

History
--------------
It is originally based off a 2.2 patch version of MANGOS which is based off a project by WoW-Daemons. This is for the 3.3.5a version with a fully functioning Wintergrasp and Ulduar.
